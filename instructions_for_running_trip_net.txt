Instructions to obtain results on more bytes:
	Navigate to the triplet/notebooks directory.
	There are four notebooks that will be used for collecting results for more bytes:
		1) Step 1 - Pre-Training -- Training a triplet model.ipynb
		2) Step 2.1 - Fine-tuning - 2 -- Training 256 k-NN with N traces overall.ipynb
		3) Step 3 - Ranks Generation -- 256 k-NN for XMEGA-STM32F - Unmasked & Masked.ipynb
		4) Step 4 - Graph Generation -- 256 k-NN for XMEGA-STM32F - Unmasked-Masked.ipynb
	Additional details of each individual notebook can be found within the notebook itself.
		These details include a description of what the notebook does, a description of the input parameters, and the underlying code.
		Some notebooks also contain functions found within the files of the triplet/utilities directory.
	The above notebooks are run in order from notebook 1 to notebook 4.
	Notebook time to complete (based off of lab machine. Specs found below):
		1) ~2.75 hours
		2) ~8 minutes
		3) ~18 hours
		4) ~20 seconds
		Note:
			Although it can be expected that these times are consistent across all of the different architectures and implementations (XMEGA/STM32F and unmasked/masked), these values are based off of the XMEGA-unmasked dataset usage)

Instructions for finding points of interest:
	Navigate to the triplet/notebooks directory.
	There are two sets of notebooks that will be used for this.
		Notebooks:
			TVLA:
				1) TVLA - 1.ipynb
				2) TVLA - Graph Generation.ipynb
				3) TVLA - Graph Comparison Generation.ipynb
			NICV:
				4) NICV - 1.ipynb
				5) NICV - Graph Generation.ipynb
				6) NICV - Graph Comparison Generation.ipynb
	Additional details of each individual notebook can be found within the notebook itself.
		These details include a description of what the notebook does, a description of the input parameters, and the underlying code.
		Some notebooks also contain functions found within the files of the triplet/utilities directory.
		Details of what these evaluation methods can be read from the following references:
			TVLA: https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2015/92930478/92930478.pdf
			NICV: https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/717.pdf
	The TVLA - 1.ipynb or NICV - 1.ipynb file must be ran prior to running the graph-related notebooks of each method.
	Notebook time to complete (based off of lab machine. Specs found below):
		1, 4) 5 mins - 15 mins
		2, 3, 5, 6) Very little amount of time
	
Dependencies:
	The following are a list of current library versions being run within the triplet directory.
		Python: 3.6.12 ANACONDA
		Pandas: 1.1.3
		tensorflow: 2.3.1
		matplotlib: 3.3.4
		numpy: 1.19.5
		sklearn: 0.23.2
	Misc:
		Install ipython-autotime
	The libraries were installed in the above order from top-to-bottom. It's likely that some packages will reinstall up-to-date versions of the earlier libraries.
	
	
	
Additional Notes:
	target_byte parameter:
		XMEGA/STM32F unmasked:
			This value ranges from 0 to 15
		XMEGA-masked:
			This value ranges from 2 to 15
	start_idx/end_idx:
		XMEGA-unmasked:
			start_idx: 1800
			end_idx: 2800
		STM32F3-unmasked:
			start_idx: 1200
			end_idx: 2200
		XMEGA-masked:
			start_idx: 1600
			end_idx: 4500
	Descriptions of the time for each notebook to complete is based on the lab machine used for experiements. These specs are:
		Ubuntu 18.04
		2.8GHz CPU
		32GB memory
		one NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU
